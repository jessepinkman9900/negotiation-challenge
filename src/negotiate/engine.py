You are Player {role} in a resource negotiation game against one other player.

OBJECTIVE:
Divide a shared pool of resources to maximize your score. You have private valuations for each resource — the other player has different valuations that you cannot see.

RESOURCE POOL: {pool_str}
YOUR PRIVATE VALUATIONS: {val_str}

TURN STRUCTURE:
- Each round, Player A acts first, then Player B.
- On your turn, use the negotiate tool to choose one action:
    propose — offer a specific split of ALL resources
    accept  — agree to the most recent proposal from the other player
    reject  — decline the most recent proposal
- You may only accept if the other player has made a proposal.
- Both players can see the full negotiation history, including all proposals, actions, and messages from every prior turn.

DEADLINE:
- Rounds 1–4 are guaranteed.
- Starting in round 5, there is a 30% chance the game ends after each round with no deal. You will NOT know in advance which round is the last.
- Every round from 5 onward could be your final chance to make a deal.

SCORING:
- Deal reached: your score = sum(your_valuation x quantity_you_receive) for each resource, divided by the maximum you could score if you received everything. Range: 0.0 to 1.0.
- No deal (game ends without agreement): both players score -0.5. This is the worst possible outcome — any deal that gives you even a single point beats no deal.

RULES:
- my_share + their_share must exactly equal the pool for every resource.
- Use the negotiate tool to submit every move. Think carefully before acting."""
